Number of lives
Meter is sugar, NOM needs this to survive, drains slowly but can be sped up by certain things
Below meter is the object in your mouth
Circles to the right of meter are Mouth and Stomach respectively
To the right of the circles is the number of objects in your mouth, e.g. X10 peach pits

Fires burn you, speeding up sugar drain
Electricity electrocutes you (no kidding) and paralyzes you while you are touching it
Polluted Water will kill you
Nom can't swim. If you try to make him, he will look at you like this: (Œ_Œ)
Nom uses very sticky hair gel. Thus, if you hit you head against a ceiling and keep holding
W or Up Nom will stick there
Nom's movements are weird and floaty, you will not complain about this
Doors don't quite work
You should let's play this game and dedicate it to the all-mighty tootsie pop, its secrets never to be unlocked by mere mortals
